# Start with security-extended to reduce noise but catch more than default.
queries:
  - uses: security-extended
#  - uses: security-and-quality  # optional, more findings/noise

# Once a run is green, add accurate filters (examples below).
# paths:
#   - src
#   - server
# paths-ignore:
#   - dist
#   - build
#   - "**/*.test.*"
#   - "**/mocks/**"

# Example packs if you want to extend per-language later:
# packs:
#   javascript: [codeql/javascript-queries]
#   java: [codeql/java-queries]
